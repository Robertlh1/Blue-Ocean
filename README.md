## Introduction
This project was a 1 week sprint where our team completed a Minimum Viable Product for an external client.
The client requested a learning site where users could sign up as either students or mentors and connect with eachother via instant messaging and video chat.

I was in charge of the profiles section which is the core of the site that everything else connects through, and it was a really fun experience for me working with the rest of the team to ensure that everything worked well together.

## What does the app do?
* Authenticates user login information via OAuth 2.0
* Allows mentors to select skills that they want to tutor in
* Allows students to book appointments with mentors via Google Calendar integration
* Allows mentors and students to communicate via embedded video chat and instant messaging implemented via Socket.io
